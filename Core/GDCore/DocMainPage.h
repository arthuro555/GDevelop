 * \section welcome GDeveloppe Core documentation
 *
 * The **GDeveloppe Core** library contains the structure of a GDeveloppe game, classes and tools that are used by the *platforms* and the *GDeveloppe IDE*.
 *
 * \section gettingstarted Getting started
 *
 * In most cases, you should start by <a href="https://github.com/4ian/GDeveloppe/blob/master/newIDE/README.md">installing and launching the development version of GDeveloppe</a>.
 *
 * - If you're interested in writing extensions for GDeveloppe, read <a href="https://github.com/4ian/GDeveloppe/blob/master/newIDE/README-extensions.md">the documentation about extensions</a>.
 * - If you want to dig more into how GDeveloppe is architectured and work on the core, read <a href="https://github.com/4ian/GDeveloppe/blob/master/Core/GDeveloppe-Architecture-Overview.md">GDeveloppe Architecture Overview</a>. Then, you can browse this reference to get more information about a class or function.
 *
 * \section other Other documentations
 *
 * GDeveloppe is architectured around a `Core` (this library), a game engine (`GDJS`) and extensions (`Extensions` folder). The editor (`newIDE` folder) is using all of these libraries.
