# Devcontainer (development environment in the cloud) for GDevelop (beta)

A devcontainer is the configuration to run a cloud development environment, available remotely.
This is notably used to run a **[GitHub Codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces)**. The advantage is that you can quickly experiment and do changes without installing anything on your computer.

> ⚠️ This development environment is in beta, and not everything is supported. This is useful for playing a bit with GDevelop codebase or to make quick changes. **In particular, it's not possible to test your changes on GDJS** because only the web-app can be launched.

It's recommended that you follow the usual [README](../newIDE/README.md) to get started, with development tools installed on your computer.

## Start a GitHub workspace to work on GDevelop (beta)

- Subscribe to the [beta edition of GitHub workspace](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/about-codespaces#joining-the-beta).
- In the repository GitHub page, click **Code** and then choose **Open with Codespaces**.
- Wait for the Codespace to load and Visual Studio Code to open.
- When it's ready, open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
- Follow the usual [README in `newIDE`](../newIDE/README.md) to get started, like you would do on your own computer.
