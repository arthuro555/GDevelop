GDevelop is a full-featured, open-source game development software, allowing to create HTML5 and native games without any knowledge in a specific programming language. All the game logic is built up using an intuitive and powerful event-based system.

| Directory | ℹ️ Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Core` | GDevelop core library, containing common tools to implement the IDE and work with GDevelop games. |
| `GDCpp` | The C++ game engine, used to build native games (*not used in GDevelop 5*). |
| `GDJS` | The JavaScript game engine, using Pixi.js (WebGL), powering all GDevelop games. |
| `GDevelop.js` | Bindings of `Core`/`GDCpp`/`GDJS` and `Extensions` to JavaScript (with WebAssembly), used by the IDE. |
| `newIDE` | The game editor, written in JavaScript with React, Electron and Pixi.js. |
| `Extensions` | Extensions for the C++ or JavaScript game engines, providing objects, behaviors, events and new features. |
